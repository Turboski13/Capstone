        <h2>How the Game Proceeds</h2>
        <p>Your DM will begin by creating a scene for you to play out, with a specific goal to attain. You will describe the backstory you wish your character to have, and proceed to play out your character's reactions to events as you believe they may actually react</p>
        <p>As the stor progresses, you may need to defend yourself. you wwill be told by the DM which stat you need to roll for in order to defend agains an attack. An attack may be verbal, physical or enviromental.</p>
        <p>Yo may also have the chance to take an action. In this case you would use a skill. Most skills can be used repeatedly, but some of your skills may only be single use, and you will need to rest inbetween each use.</p>
        <p>As you play, you will gain experience points. These points can be used to level up your character, and gain new skills. You may also gain new skills by completing certain tasks, or by finding them in the game.</p>
        <h2>Winning the Game</h2>
        <p>When you and your team have accomplished your event, or utterly failed at it, then the game will be completed.</p>
